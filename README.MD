Overview
This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) web application that utilizes state-of-the-art technologies to recognize and extract text from images. The application is built using the ColPali implementation from the Byaldi library, combined with the Hugging Face Transformers for the Qwen2-VL model. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading images, performing OCR, and searching for specific keywords within the recognized text.
Tech Stack
1. Gradio
Gradio is a Python library that allows you to quickly create web-based user interfaces for machine learning models. It simplifies the process of deploying models by providing a straightforward way to build interactive demos. With Gradio, users can upload files, input text, and view outputs directly in their web browser without needing extensive frontend development skills.
2. Byaldi Library
The Byaldi library offers advanced implementations of various multi-modal models, including ColPali, which is specifically designed for OCR tasks. ColPali excels at recognizing text in images and can handle various fonts and layouts. By integrating this library, we leverage its capabilities to perform high-quality OCR, making it suitable for diverse applications ranging from document scanning to image analysis.
3. Hugging Face Transformers
The Hugging Face Transformers library is a widely-used framework for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. It provides pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or used out-of-the-box. In this project, we utilize the Qwen2-VL model, which is optimized for image and text processing. This model enhances our application's ability to understand context and semantics in both visual and textual data.
4. Python
Python serves as the primary programming language for this project due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that facilitate machine learning and web development. Its simplicity and readability make it an ideal choice for rapid prototyping and deployment of data-driven applications.
